Hi - I am a relative novice but I know that I have been a victim on a very severe fileless malware attack on my network 
(I am a Mac user). I am unable to afford obtaining a full service team to assist with regaining security. AV apps and 
Apple respond only to proof of Malware. I have kept Mac logs from my devices that provide evidence of serious penetration 
of all systems/programs but they wont respond to the logs. I have documented remote FTP access of my terminal to which I 
have now lost control along with up to a thousand active processes, multiple open ports and many hosts and P/PIDs. I have 
documented an accumulated addition of close to 100,000 'files' now on my device (e.g. frameworks, daemons, programs, files 
e.g. plists. I have lost many permissions including entire System volume. I am in desperate need of affordable help to 
either fix this nightmare or I would value assistance on what files, coding, etc. that would force providers eg ISP, AV 
app, Apple to acknowledge fileless malware attack and its life altering persistence. (I have deleted and, changed and 
reinstalled everything imaginable multiple times but I cannot secure the established server connection and remote port 
control which is the root of this issue.) Any legitimate help, leads etc. would be lifesaving. I'm a novice but I did 
do research (as well as consulted with my providers) and I have done likely every standard to slightly above standard 
intervention already if that helps in any potential assistance. 

Thank you very much for your potential consideration to help.

Kevin
